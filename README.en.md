# Bitcoin Backtest Lab

A local BTC/USDT research workbench with a separate TypeScript backtest engine, historical-data validation, and Python strategy callbacks.

The project demonstrates research infrastructure: explicit execution assumptions, inspectable trade accounting, and persistence. Strategy results are simulations and depend on the stated model.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 22.13+; Python 3.9+ for Python callbacks.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5173. Use the explicitly labelled synthetic demo to explore the workbench without downloading market data. The interface is in Turkish; the full operating guide is in [README.md](README.md).

## Where to review the engineering

| Component | Location | What to inspect |
|---|---|---|
| Backtest engine | `shared/engine.ts` | Next-bar execution, fees, slippage, stops, equity and benchmarks |
| Calculation tests | `tests/engine.test.ts` | Hand-checkable trade accounting and historical-fill invariance |
| Rule evaluation | `tests/candle-rules.test.ts` | Custom candle conditions |
| Python integration | `tests/python.test.ts` | Strategy callbacks and process behavior |
| Data and persistence | `tests/market.test.ts`, `tests/storage.test.ts` | Historical data and workspace handling |
| Local API boundary | `tests/local-access.test.ts` | Local request access controls |

On 13 September 2026, the existing unit suite passed **78 tests across 6 files** at revision `d457582fd25bc41c2a0216d524df713ef4a2e2b3`. This is a unit-test result; live exchange and browser integration checks were not rerun in that review.

## Evaluation model

- Only closed, continuous OHLCV candles are accepted. Signals execute at the following candle’s open.
- The portfolio is spot, long-only, unlevered, and holds at most one position.
- Entry and exit both incur commission and adverse slippage. Unallocated capital stays in cash.
- If stop-loss and take-profit are both crossed inside a candle, the stop takes precedence. Stop gaps use the opening price.
- Equity is marked at candle closes. The engine closes a remaining position at the end of the sample.
- The buy-and-hold comparator uses the same fee and slippage settings, with full capital allocation.

The model does not simulate order-book liquidity, partial fills, market impact, funding or short borrowing. OHLCV data cannot establish the exact intrabar path. The reported annualized Sharpe uses bar returns and is descriptive, not a significance test. Repeated strategy selection on the same data is not independent out-of-sample validation.

## Reproducible examples and sharing

Synthetic demo data are deterministic and labelled separately from market data. Existing workspace backups may include personal reports and custom strategy code; they are not required for a reviewer to inspect the engine or run its unit tests. Python callbacks execute trusted local code and are not a multi-user sandbox.

A useful next experiment is a frozen chronological comparison of simple baselines, with data provenance, parameters, and result artifacts saved together. No predictive advantage is claimed by the existence of this workbench.
